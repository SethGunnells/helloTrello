# Hello, Trello!

There's nothing like a more realistic project to learn a technology. This
project is serving as my trial run in learning more about React, but
specifically focusing on Redux. I like the one-directional data flow model and
I am excited to learn more about the potential and the scalability of this
approach.

The goal is to build a simple Trello clone. It's focused on the front-end
primarily, but I may expand it to include some back-end technology as well.

I welcome any feedback on coding style or approach. You can open an issue to
discuss it with me. Thanks for checking out my work!
